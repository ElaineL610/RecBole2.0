# RecBole2.0
In order to support the study of recent advances in recommender
systems, we presents an extended recommendation library
consisting of benchmarking packages for up-to-date topics and
architectures. First of all, from a data perspective, we consider
three important topics related to data issues (i.e., sparsity, bias and
distribution shift), and develop four benchmarking packages: data
augmentation, debiasing and fairness and cross-domain recommen-
dation. Furthermore, from a model perspective, we develop two
benchmarking packages for transformer-based and graph neural
network (GNN)-based models, respectively. All the benchmarking
packages (consisting of 50+ new models) are developed based on a
popular recommendation framework RecBole, ensuring that both
the implementation and interface are unified. For each package, we
provide complete implementations from data loading, experimental
setup, evaluation and algorithm implementation. This library is of
great value to facilitate the up-to-date research in recommender
systems.
