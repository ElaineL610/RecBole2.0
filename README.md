# RecBole 2.0
Based on a popular recommendation framework [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Recbole), we develop an extended recommendation library called RecBole 2.0, consisting of benchmarking packages for up-to-date topics and architectures. 

RecBole 2.0 includes 7 packages covering the up-to-date research topic in recommender system:

* Data augmentation
* Meta recommendation
* Debiased recommendation
* Fairness-aware recommendation
* Cross-domain recommendation
* Graph-based recommendation
* Transformer-based recommendation

For each package, we provide complete implementations from data loading, experimental
setup, evaluation and algorithm implementation. This library is of great value to facilitate the up-to-date research in recommender
systems.

## [RecBole-MetaRec](https://github.com/nuster1128/RecBole-MetaRec)

## [RecBole-Debias](https://github.com/JingsenZhang/RecBole-Debias)
**RecBole-Debias** is a toolkit built upon [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole) for reproducing and developing debiased recommendation algorithms.

### 1）Highlights

* **Unified**

    A unified framework, which includes several algorithms for different kinds of biases. Meanwhile, three datasets with the different distributions of training set and test set are provided for training and evaluation.

* **Adaptive**

    Adaptive to many base recommendation models. For simplicity, the current implementation is only based on MF model.
    
* **Closely**

    Closely related to Recbole. The toolkit fully adopts the functions of Recbole, except that certain algorithms need to design unique components like trainer.

### 2）Implemented Models

We list currently supported models according to category:

* **Base Model**: MF
* **Selection Bias**: MF-IPS
* **Popularity Bias**: PDA, MACR, DICE, CausE
* **Exposure Bias**: Rel-MF


### 3）The Team

RecBole-Debias is developed and maintained by members from [RUCAIBox](http://aibox.ruc.edu.cn/), the main developers is Jingsen Zhang ([@Jingsen Zhang](https://github.com/JingsenZhang)).

## [RecBole-CDR](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole-CDR)

## [RecBole-GNN](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole-GNN)
**RecBole-GNN** is a library built upon [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole) for reproducing and developing recommendation algorithms based on graph neural networks (GNNs). 

### 1）Highlights

* **Easy-to-use and unified API**:
    Our library shares unified API and input (atomic files) as RecBole.
* **Efficient and reusable graph processing**:
    We provide highly efficient and reusable basic datasets, dataloaders and layers for graph processing and learning.
* **Extensive graph library**:
    Graph neural networks from widely-used library like [PyG](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) are incorporated. Recently proposed graph algorithms can be easily equipped and compared with existing methods.

### 2）Implemented Models

Our library includes algorithms covering three major categories:

* **General Recommendation**: NGCF, LightGCN, SGL, HMLET, NCL, SimGCL
* **Sequential Recommendation**: SR-GNN, GC-SAN, NISER, LESSR, TAGNN, GCE-GNN, SGNN-HN
* **Social Recommendation**: DiffNet, MHCN, SEPT
